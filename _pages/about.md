I am currently completing my PhD in bioinformatics, with a focus on the analysis of single-cell time-series datasets. My research primarily involves temporally resolved lineage tracing, aiming to better understand cellular processes over time.

The goal of my research is to contribute to a deeper understanding of cellular dynamics, particularly in the context of response to treatment and disease progression.
